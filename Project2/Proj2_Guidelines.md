## Submissions  
+ You need to submit the following three items:
  + **Source code:** Compress your project folder. The folder must consist of all your source code
    files. I will use this folder to run your application. Submit the source code on blackboard.
  + **Project Report:** This report contains assumptions, a UML diagram, Big-O of the significant
    functions, and references.
  + **Individual Report:** A short report (preferably one page only) for each team member. Each
    team member should mention his/her contributions, and what was learned in the project,
    other comments. Further, each person should briefly mention the other team member’s
    contributions. You might lose 40% of the grade if you don’t submit this report.

Here’s the template for the [individual report][Individual Report] if you aren't working in a group


## Submission Guidelines  
_Submit everything on Canvas (no need for hard copies)._  
  + **Teams:** 
    + Each team member should submit his/her individual report separately on Canvas. 
    + The team leader should submit the source code and the project report on Canvas (one submission per team).  
      (_Please don’t e-mail me the submissions._) 
  + **Solo:**  
    + Submit all the required submissions on Canvas.
    
## Source Code  
_You can use C++, Java, or C# to implement your project._  
+ You need to submit all the files that are needed to run the project.  
  (_In C++, for instance, you will need to submit header files (.h) and cpp files._)
+ Comment your code, and choose meaningful variable and function names.
+ Follow a coding style consistently.
+ Don’t include the source code in your printed report. I will just look at it electronically.

## Report
This report should be roughly between 3-4 pages (excluding the front-page).  

**Report should contain:**
+ **Assumptions:** This section is optional. 
  + List any assumptions that you made that aren’t mentioned of the project description.
+ **A UML class diagram:** 
  + The diagram will show the classes you used, and the relationships between them.
+ **Efficiency of Algorithms:**
  + Mention the Big-O of the required functions  
    (_just the significant functions, not minor things like setters and getters_). 
  + Mention if it is possible to do better.
+ **References:**
  + Cite any references that you used.

## Examples for Inspiration
+ The phone directory project:  
  (_You can find it on Canvas_)
+ The airline system:  
  (_You can find it in the textbook, page 381._)  
  _NOTE: A sequence diagram (page 383) is not required._

## Teamwork
+ Each team should appoint a leader. 
  + It is your responsibility as a team leader to delegate responsibilities to team members.   
  + Make sure the responsibilities are relatively equal.  
  + Each team member must have a role in coding.  
+ At any point in time, if there is an issue with your team, contact me as early as possible.  
  I can’t help you when you inform me about problems too late (a day or two before the
  deadline).
+ The idea behind teamwork is that you exchange thoughts with each other.  
  Hence, teach other about your contributions.
+ Each team member’s performance will be evaluated based on the contributions that are
  mentioned in the individual report.
+ A team member who doesn’t contribute or contributes poorly will most likely get a very
  poor grade.

## Git/GitHub
+ It is optional to use Git/GitHub for source code version control. 
+ You are encouraged to use it since it is used a lot in industry nowadays. 
+ Inorder to gain a full point, you need to use Git/GitHub from the very beginning of the project.

You can also read chapters two and three of this [book][GitHubBook] 
+ You will gain one extra point within the scope of the project if you provide evidence of
using GitHub. I need the GitHub URL for the project, which will give me an idea about the
commits and contributions of team members.
